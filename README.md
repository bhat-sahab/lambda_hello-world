**Title: Simple Hello World Lambda Function in Python**

**Description:**

This Python script defines a Lambda function named `lambda_handler` that returns a simple "Hello world!" message in a JSON response format. It's designed for deployment in serverless environments like AWS Lambda.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x installed

**How to Use:**

1. **Save the Code:** Create a Python file (e.g., `hello_world.py`) and paste the following code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "text/plain"
        },
        "body": "Hello world!"
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lambda_handler('demo', 'run')  # For local testing (optional)
```

2. **Local Testing (Optional):**
   - If you want to test the function locally, uncomment the code block under `if __name__ == "__main__":`. This will execute the function and print the JSON response to the console.

3. **Deployment:**
   - The specific deployment steps will vary depending on your chosen serverless platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions). Refer to the documentation of your platform for detailed instructions.

**Further Considerations:**

- This is a basic example. For production-ready Lambda functions, consider error handling, logging, environment variables, and security best practices.
- The Lambda runtime environment might have limitations on file system access and dependencies. Be mindful of external libraries when deploying.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `#!/usr/bin/python3` line at the beginning specifies the Python interpreter to use when running the script directly.
- The `lambda_handler` function takes two arguments:
    - `event`: This dictionary contains information about the event that triggered the Lambda function (e.g., HTTP request details).
    - `context`: This object provides additional information about the context of the Lambda execution (e.g., remaining execution time, memory utilization).
- The function returns a dictionary with the following keys:
    - `statusCode`: The HTTP status code of the response (200 indicates success).
    - `headers`: A dictionary containing HTTP headers for the response (here, setting "Content-Type" to "text/plain").
    - `body`: The actual content of the response ("Hello world!" in this case).
